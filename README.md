# Develop Me Simple Git Exercise

This repository has been set up as a simple example to use to practice working on and committing work to a remote Git repository.

It is a simple [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) webpage that has had the [Carousel](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/carousel/) theme applied.

## Structure
/css holds all of the stylesheets
/fonts holds the fonts
/js holds the Javascript

## Customisation
To make changes you can edit the index.html file.

Styling changes should ONLY be made in /css/customisations.css, which keeps the bootstrap framework's styling untouched.
